# MEA Absorption Column

## 🧪 Overview
This is a custom Python-based model built to simulate an amine-based absorption column. The model is intended for quick, flexible simulation of post-combustion carbon capture processes.

## 🎯 Purpose
The goal of this model is to enable the development and further the research of Post-Combustion Carbon Capture. It supports rapid simulations using a variety of numerical methods such as:
- Shooting Method  
- Finite Difference  
- Collocation  

All design variables and parameters are customizable, making the tool adaptable to the user's research or engineering needs.

## ⚙️ Status
The model is currently under active development.  
✅ **Functional** – It can already produce consistent results with the current implementation.

## 🚀 Usage
To run the model, execute the main file which will call the `Run_Model` function. This function requires a pandas DataFrame of inputs (design variables and parameters).
